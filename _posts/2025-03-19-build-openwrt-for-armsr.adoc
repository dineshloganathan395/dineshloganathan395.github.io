= Build your own OpenWrt firmware for armsr target

In the previous article https://dineshloganathan395.github.io/posts/explore-openwrt-on-emulated-hardware/[Explore OpenWrt on Emulated hardware],
We have seen how to explore OpenWrt without a real hardware. OpenWrt is emulated
using qemu for armsr target with the pre-built image from OpenWrt's Snapshot
downloads for armsr-armv8. In this article, we can build our own custom Images
for armsr target using https://github.com/openwrt/openwrt[OpenWrt Build]
and can emulate OpenWrt using qemu with the custom generated image.

Building your own OpenWrt firmware has several advantages like

1. Explore OpenWrt components, features and packages
2. Explore the build system and architecture
3. Explore new features which are not part of the pre-built images
4. Optimize the OpenWrt firmware by having only the mandatory packages
5. Build firmware with custom changes to understand the feature better
6. Develop and Implement new features in OpenWrt
7. Bring-up new hardware support in OpenWrt

== Build OpenWrt for armsr-armv8

**Development**

To build your own firmware you need a GNU/Linux, BSD or macOS system (case
sensitive filesystem required). Cygwin is unsupported because of the lack of a
case sensitive file system.

**Requirements**

You need the following tools to compile OpenWrt, the package names vary between
distributions. A complete list with distribution specific packages is found in
the https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-developer/build-system/install-buildsystem[Build System Setup]
documentation.

[source,sh]
----
binutils bzip2 diff find flex gawk gcc-6+ getopt grep install libc-dev libz-dev
make4.1+ perl python3.7+ rsync subversion unzip which
----

=== OpenWrt repo initialization

* Clone the OpenWRT repo using the command

[source,sh]
----
git clone https://github.com/openwrt/openwrt.git
cd openwrt
----

=== Checkout to Latest Stable release (optional)

* Checkout to OpenWrt latest stable release - v24.10.0

[source,sh]
----
git checkout v24.10.0
----

=== Update & Install feeds

1. Run `./scripts/feeds update -a` to obtain all the latest package definitions
   defined in feeds.conf / feeds.conf.default

2. Run `./scripts/feeds install -a` to install symlinks for all obtained
   packages into package/feeds/

=== Configure Build Target profile

* Select and save armsr target profile using the **make menuconfig** command in the below sequence

[source,sh]
----
1. Target System -> Arm SystemReady (EFI) compliant
2. Subtarget -> 64-bit (armv8) machines
3. Target Profile -> Generic EFI Boot
4. Save -> .config
5. Exit -> Yes
----

=== Trigger OpenWrt build

* Execute the below command to trigger the OpenWrt build

[source,bash]
----
make V=e -j$(nproc)
----

=== Build Artifacts

List of OpenWrt Firmware Images generated for armsr devices

* **Kernel & Rootfs Image** - bin/targets/armsr/armv8/openwrt-armsr-armv8-generic-squashfs-combined-efi.img.gz
* **u-boot Image** - bin/targets/armsr/armv8/u-boot-qemu_armv8/u-boot.bin

== Running OpenWrt using qemu with generated Images

In the bin directory of the OpenWrt build, Decompress the
`openwrt-armsr-armv8-generic-squashfs-combined-efi.img.gz` into `openwrt-arm-64.img`

[source,sh]
----
cd bin/targets/armsr/armv8/

gunzip -c openwrt-armsr-armv8-generic-squashfs-combined-efi.img.gz > openwrt-arm-64.img
----

Emulate OpenWrt for armsr-armv8 target using `qemu-system-aarch64` command with
the default arguments for kernel, rootfs image, cpu and network options.

[source,sh]
----
qemu-system-aarch64 -nographic \
    -cpu cortex-a53 -machine virt \
    -bios u-boot-qemu_armv8/u-boot.bin \
    -smp 1 -m 1024 \
    -device virtio-rng-pci \
    -drive file=openwrt-arm-64.img,format=raw,index=0,media=disk \
    -netdev user,id=testlan -net nic,netdev=testlan \
    -netdev user,id=testwan -net nic,netdev=testwan

=== Walkthrough OpenWrt bootlog for armsr-armv8

* OpenWrt is successfully booted for armsr-armv8 target with our custom Image.

* Below excerpt from the OpenWrt bootlog, covers the following stages of booting,
  ** Booting : U-Boot
  ** Booting : Linux kernel with version `Linux version 6.6.73`
  ** OpenWrt prompt

== Unlocking New Explorations in OpenWrt

With OpenWrt running on qemu with our custom built Image, It opens up a way to
build, modify, test existing OpenWrt packages (or) Create a new packages which
can be executed/validated on the emulated hardware and allows for endless option
to learn OpenWrt and its build system.
