= Build and upgrade prplOS on Banana Pi R4

In the previous article
https://dineshloganathan395.github.io/posts/getting-started-with-prplos-on-banana-pi-r4[Getting Started with prplOS on Banana Pi R4],
we have seen how to explore prplOS Image on Banana PI R4.
prplOS is booted using the pre-built image downloaded from the github repo.
In this article, we can build our own custom prplOS Image for Banana PI R4
including custom modifications and local patches added to support the new hardware.

prplOS can be built for any OpenWrt compatible devices with custom build instructions
tailored to the Target hardware and has several advantages like

1. Explore the prplOS build system and architecture
2. Bring-up new hardware support within prplOS
3. Adapt and configure prplOS to harness all supported features on new hardware
4. Explore prplOS components, features and packages
5. Develop and Integrate new features in prplOS

== Build prplOS Image for Banana Pi R4

**bpi-r4-dev-resources**

https://github.com/dineshloganathan395/bpi-r4-dev-resources[bpi-r4-dev-resources]
is my github repo which contains Banana Pi R4 related dev resources like

* Custom patches
* Build Configurations
* Image artifacts

For building prplOS for the Banana Pi R4 using the prplos-v4.0.0 release,
**Download** the required patch from the **bpi-r4-dev-resources** github repo

[source,sh]

**Setting Up the prplOS Build Environment**

For detailed instructions on setting up the build environment, refer to the
https://gitlab.com/prpl-foundation/prplos/prplos/-/wikis/Building-prplOS[Building-prplOS]
page on the official wiki.

**1. Initialize prplOS repository**

Clone the prplOS repository using the below command and navigate to the prplos
build directory

[source,sh]
----
git clone https://gitlab.com/prpl-foundation/prplos/prplos.git
cd prplos
----

Checkout to prplOS latest stable release, **prplos-v4.0.0**

[source,sh]
----
git checkout prplos-v4.0.0
----

**2. Add Banana Pi R4 support in prplos**

To add Banana Pi R4 support in prplOS, a custom set of patches needs to be
applied to the prplos directory.

These patches enable the following features:

* Include Banana Pi R4's Target Device model name in mtk_filogic.yml, allowing the BPI-R4 to be built as part of prplOS.

* Integrate the latest uboot-mediatek from OpenWrt to add support for Banana PI R4

* Disable Banana PI R4 snand builds since snand support is currently not available

* Enable arm-trusted-firmware and u-boot-mt7988 related packages specific to the Banana Pi R4

* Update LAN and WAN interface names to lan1 and wan, matching the Banana Pi R4â€™s interface naming

Apply the relevant patches in prplos directory using the follow command

[source,sh]
----
git am ~/Downloads/bpi-r4-dev-resources/prplos/prplos-v4.0.0/Patches/prplos/*.patch
----

**3. Configure Target profile for prplOS build**

gen_config.py is a Python helper script in prplOS that simplifies selecting the
target device profile and features required for building prplOS images.

It automatically configures the necessary build options, target architecture,
and packages based on the selected profile instead of using `make menuconfig` to
select and configure the Target.

To configure the build for Banana Pi R4, run the following command:

[source,sh]
----
./scripts/gen_config.py mtk_filogic prpl security
----

Here:

* `mtk_filogic` specifies the target architecture (MediaTek Filogic).

* `prpl` enables prpl specific packages and configurations.

* `security` includes additional security-related packages for the build.

**4. Add Banana Pi R4 support in feed_mediatek**

The feed_mediatek directory contains the below for building prplOS on MediaTek
platforms

1. Target related files
2. Kernel related DTS, Configs, Files and Patches
3. Mediatek specific driver and packages

A custom set of patches needs to be applied to the feed_mediatek directory which
includes custom changes for necessary image generation and network configurations
to build and boot prplOS Image on Banana Pi R4 device

These patches includes the following custom changes

1. Disable generating snand build artifacts
2. Remove eth2 from WAN interface mapping for bpi-r4

Apply the relevant patches in feed_mediatek directory using the follow command

[source,sh]
----
git am ~/Downloads/bpi-r4-dev-resources/prplos/prplos-v4.0.0/Patches/feed_mediatek/*.patch
----

**5. Build prplOS**

Finally, start building prplOS with the following make command

[source,bash]
----
make V=e -j$(nproc)
----

**Build Artifacts**

Below is the list of prplOS firmware images generated for Banana Pi R4

* **SD Card Image** - bin/targets/mediatek/filogic/prplos-mediatek-filogic-bananapi_bpi-r4-sdcard.img.gz
* **Sysupgrade Image** - bin/targets/mediatek/filogic/prplos-mediatek-filogic-bananapi_bpi-r4-squashfs-sysupgrade.itb

== Upgrade prplOS Image on Banana PI R4

=== Method 1 : Burn prplOS Image to SD Card

Burn prplOS Image to SD Card using the instructions provided in the official
https://docs.banana-pi.org/en/BPI-R4/GettingStarted_BPI-R4[Banana PI R4 document].
Once the Image is burned, Insert the SD Card into Banana PI R4 and switch
Boot Jumper to boot from SD.

Power on the Banana Pi R4 to boot your own prplOS Image from the SD card.

=== Method 2: Image upgrade through Sysupgrade feature

If prplOS Image is already flashed in the Banana PI R4, We can use sysupgrade
feature to upgrade the latest image without updating the SD card manually.

* Copy the Sysupgrade Image into Banana PI R4 using the scp command

We could now able to build and upgrade latest prplOS Image through various Image
upgrade methods in Banana PI R4. It opens up a way to build and explore prplOS
architecture through various customizations of our own.

In the future posts, we will cover how to enable, explore WiFi and other prplOS
related features in Banana PI R4.
