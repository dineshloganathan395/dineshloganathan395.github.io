= Explore OpenWrt on Emulated hardware

== OpenWrt - An overview

OpenWrt (Open Wireless RouTer) is an open-source project for creating an
embedded operating systems based on Linux. OpenWrt is designed for embedded
devices, particularly routers and is capable to run in range of hardware products,
be it low memory Wi-Fi routers, CPE routers, residential gateways, access points
and so on. In this article, the possibilities of booting up a
router operating system like OpenWrt without a physical hardware is unravelled.

**Features of OpenWrt**

Below are the few key features of OpenWrt

* Configuration over command line interface (or) web interface(LuCI)
* Customization
* Performance and Stability
* Advanced Networking Features like firewall, VLAN, VPN, QoS and so on
* Enhanced Security
* Mesh Networking
* Package Management using opkg/apkg package manager

=== Unleash OpenWrt on non-physical hardware

While OpenWrt is primarily designed for embedded devices like routers, it's not
strictly limited to real hardware and can also be run in virtual machines (VMs),
emulator, or on x86 hardware. OpenWrt provides QEMU packages for ARM and x86
platforms to explore the OS without the need of real hardware's using emulators.

QEMU (Quick EMUlator) is a powerful, open-source processor emulator and
virtualizer. QEMU can emulate various CPU architectures (like x86, ARM and so
on) and hardware devices allowing you to run software and operating systems
designed for those architectures on your current system.

This articles helps us to emulate OpenWrt using qemu in Arm SystemReady target

== Arm SystemReady

`Arm SystemReady (or) armsr` is an openwrt target that is developed based on
https://community.arm.com/arm-community-blogs/b/architectures-and-processors-blog/posts/arm-systemready[Arm
SystemReady compliance program] where an Operating System image will be
compatible across ARM based hardware manufacturers.

Arm SystemReady is implemented in alignment with the two OS environment and
firmware approaches commonly used to generate and install the OS Images. These
are split into the following bands

. https://www.arm.com/architecture/system-architectures/systemready-compliance-program/systemready-band[SystemReady band]
. https://www.arm.com/architecture/system-architectures/systemready-compliance-program/systemready-devicetree-band[SystemReady Devicetree band]

OpenWrt uses the SystemReady Devicetree band, where the preferred method of
booting the OS is based on the hardware devicetree.

=== Arm SystemReady on OpenWrt

`armsr` takes over from the previous `armvirt` target in OpenWrt and adds
support for Arm systems that support booting EFI images. armsr supports the below
subtargets

. armv7 for 32-bit machines
. armv8 for 64-bit machines

QEMU can be used to emulate `armsr` target running OpenWrt without the needs for
real hardware.

Refer https://github.com/openwrt/openwrt/tree/main/target/linux/armsr[OpenWrt Target -> armsr -> README]
to get the detailed instructions on how to boot the OpenWrt SystemReady image.

== Running OpenWrt using qemu

For Running OpenWrt on QEMU, we can use `armsr-armv8` as a reference target to boot
and analyse OpenWrt OS.

Prebuilt Images are available and can be downloaded from the OpenWrt's Snapshot
downloads for https://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/targets/armsr/armv8/[armsr-armv8].

Download the below image files from the OpenWrt link for emulating armsr target
using qemu.

. openwrt-armsr-armv8-generic-squashfs-combined-efi.img.gz
. u-boot-qemu_armv8/u-boot.bin

Decompress the `generic-squashfs-combined-efi.img.gz` into `openwrt-arm-64.img`

[source,sh]
----
gunzip -c openwrt-armsr-armv8-generic-squashfs-combined-efi.img.gz > openwrt-arm-64.img
----

Emulate OpenWrt for armsr-armv8 target using `qemu-system-aarch64` command with
the default arguments for kernel, rootfs image, cpu and network options.

[source,sh]
----
qemu-system-aarch64 -nographic \
    -cpu cortex-a53 -machine virt \
    -bios u-boot.bin \
    -smp 1 -m 1024 \
    -device virtio-rng-pci \
    -drive file=openwrt-arm-64.img,format=raw,index=0,media=disk \
    -netdev user,id=testlan -net nic,netdev=testlan \
    -netdev user,id=testwan -net nic,netdev=testwan
