= Getting Started with prplOS on Banana Pi R4

prplOS is an open-source operating system based on OpenWrt specifically designed
for embedded networking devices like broadband customer premises equipment (CPE),
Home gateways and Wi-Fi routers.

Leveraging modern micro-services and containerized applications, prplOS can be
used to build robust, manageable, and flexible networking solutions that cater
to the evolving broadband ecosystem.

prplOS is rapidly gaining prominence in the Wi-Fi networking world due to its
rich set of features like

* Interoperability to support multiple hardware platforms
* Modular & Micro-services based architecture
* Integrated with prplMesh for seamless mesh networking solutions
* Remote Management using TR-069 (CWMP) and TR-369 (USP)
* Enhanced security and system reliability
* Flexibility & Customization
* Open and Standardized Development

https://prplfoundation.org/prplos/[prplOS] is developed and maintained by the
https://prplfoundation.org[prpl Foundation], an open source, community-driven
organization aimed to develop open source software for carrier-grade CPE through
innovation and collaboration.

To ensure Release stability, prpl Foundation validates each
https://gitlab.com/prpl-foundation/prplos/prplos/-/releases[prplOS release]
on a defined set of
https://gitlab.com/groups/prpl-foundation/-/wikis/Supported-platforms[reference platforms],
These officially supported reference platforms serve as the primary targets for
development, testing, and continuous integration in prpl.

While the prpl Foundation officially supports a defined set of reference platforms,
prplOS can be built for any OpenWrt compatible devices

This article helps us to setup and run prplOS on Banana Pi R4, a high-performance,
open-source router development board.

== Banana Pi R4 - Router development board

Banana Pi R4 is a high performance WiFi-7 router development board based on
MediaTek MT7988A (Filogic 880) processor. It offers a comprehensive set of cutting-edge
features including Wi-Fi 7 support typically seen in today's high-end routers
and serves as an excellent platform for building and testing embedded router
operating systems such as OpenWrt, RDK-B, prplOS and so on.

**Key Features**

* CPU: MediaTek MT7988A (Filogic 880) quad-core ARM Cortex-A73, 1.8GHz processor
* RAM: 4GB or 8GB DDR4
* Storage: 8GB eMMC, 128MB SPI-NAND flash, MicroSD card slot
* Network: 4 Gigabit Ethernet ports, 2x 10 Gigabit SFP ports
* WiFi : Wi-Fi 7 Tri-band (2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and 6 GHz)

== Banana PI R4 setup

Below is my Banana Pi R4 development setup, which is used for building, debugging, and
testing custom OpenWrt and prplOS images.

image::/assets/img/posts/bpi-r4/bpi-r4-setup.jpg[align="center", width=600px]

This setup includes the following components

1. Banana Pi R4 board with protective case
2. BPI-R4-NIC-BE14 WiFi 7 module
3. USB-UART adapter for console access
4. Heatsink for effective thermal management
5. 19V power supply

== Setup prplOS on Banana PI R4

Prebuilt prplOS Images for Banana PI R4 are available for download on my GitHub
repo https://github.com/dineshloganathan395/bpi-r4-dev-resources[bpi-r4-dev-resources].

Download the below files from the latest
https://github.com/dineshloganathan395/bpi-r4-dev-resources/releases/tag/bpi-r4-prplos-4.0.0[prplOS images artifacts]

. prplos-mediatek-filogic-bananapi_bpi-r4-sdcard.img.gz
. prplos-mediatek-filogic-bananapi_bpi-r4-squashfs-sysupgrade.itb

Burn prplOS Image to SD Card using the instructions provided in the official
https://docs.banana-pi.org/en/BPI-R4/GettingStarted_BPI-R4[Banana PI R4 document].
Once the Image is burned, Insert the SD Card into Banana PI R4 and switch
Boot Jumper to boot from SD.

Power on the Banana Pi R4 to boot the prplOS Image from the SD card. prplOS is
now running and ready for exploration on the Banana Pi R4.

== Unlocking New Explorations in prplOS

With prplOS running on Banana PI R4, It opens up a way to explore prplOS features
and to use Banana PI R4 as a high-performance WiFi router. Thanks to its advanced
Ethernet and WiFi capabilities, Banana PI R4 is a great reference platform for
building and testing custom prplOS Images to learn and explore prplOS features.

In the future posts, we will cover how to build your own prplOS image for
Banana Pi R4, how to enable WiFi and explore other features in prplOS.
