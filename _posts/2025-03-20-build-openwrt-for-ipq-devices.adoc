= Build your own OpenWrt firmware for IPQ devices

== OpenWrt - An overview

OpenWrt is a Linux based Open-source Operating system which are primarily used
on wireless routers and mesh devices. For users, OpenWrt means the freedom of
full customization, allowing the use of an embedded device in ways the vendor
never envisioned. Designed to be lightweight and efficient, OpenWrt is capable
to run in range of hardware products, be it low memory Wi-Fi routers, CPE routers and
so on.

OpenWrt supports a wide range of System-on-Chip (SoC) vendors including but not
limited to Airoha, Broadcom, MediaTek, Qualcomm, Realtek. SoC vendor prefers
OpenWrt based Operating System for their Wireless Routers, since it provides
Various customization, Package management, Better Security features and a great
Community support.

For Wireless chipsets in the routers, OpenWrt uses upstream/open-source version
of network drivers and packages for their respective chipsets which are freely
available and published into the open-source community.

Along with open-source contributions, SoC Vendors focus on developing the latest
features, Enhancements and Bug fixes. While most of the features are published
to the open-source community, Vendor specific features will be available only in
through their External release repos until the packages and patches are
upstreamed to the community.

== Qualcomm Internet Processor (IPQ) in Wi-Fi Product line

Qualcomm is one of the leading SoC vendors for most of the wireless routers.
Qualcomm Internet Processor (IPQ) refers to a series of System-on-Chip (SoC)
designed specifically for Wi-Fi networking devices like routers, gateways and
access points. IPQ807X, IPQ95XX and IPQ53XX are few of the latest Qualcomm SoC's
series available in the market and are utilized in the various enterprise,
retail and carrier broadband products.

Qualcomm Wi-Fi chipset details are available in the https://wikidevi.wi-cat.ru/Qualcomm[Wiki Page].

Qualcomm provides releases to the Customer and open-source community for IPQ
devices through Codelinaro website, whose source code can be downloaded based
on the details https://wiki.codelinaro.org/en/clo/qsdk/overview[here].

== feed-ipq : Collection of package recipes for IPQ devices

`feed-ipq` is an OpenWrt feed repository which helps to build latest OpenWrt
firmware for Qualcomm Wi-Fi SoC platforms (IPQ Devices), which is on-par with
the latest release from Qualcomm. This feed can be easily integrated into
OpenWrt and OpenWrt based build systems like prplOS, IOWRT and openWiFi.

`feed-ipq` is available at, https://github.com/zilogic-systems/feed-ipq

`feed-ipq` is intended to be layered on-top of an OpenWrt providing only the
required packages and files relevant for bring-up of the networking and Wi-Fi
features in the IPQ devices. This repository contains OpenWrt Target directory
files for IPQ devices, Network, Wi-Fi drivers, packages and scripts.
These can be used along with other feeds of OpenWrt.

*Directory structure*

[source,bash]
----
.
|-- feeds
|   |-- clo-upstream
|   |-- nss-host
|   |-- platform_utils
|   |-- ssdk
|   `-- wlan_utils
|-- README.md
`-- targets
    `-- ipq95xx
----

Directory structure of the feed-ipq is segregated based on the following

* `targets` - contains IPQ targets like ipq95xx and target related configs, files and patches

* `feeds`   - contains IPQ target specific drivers, packages and scripts

* `feeds/clo-upstream` - contains OpenWrt upstream components which are customized for IPQ targets

== Build Artifacts

After Integrating feed-ipq into OpenWrt, Below are the List of OpenWrt Firmware Images generated for IPQ devices

* `Kernel_Image` - build_dir/target-aarch64_cortex-a73+neon-vfpv4_musl/linux-ipq95xx_generic/qcom_rdp433-uImage.itb
* `Rootfs_Image` - build_dir/target-aarch64_cortex-a73+neon-vfpv4_musl/linux-ipq95xx_generic/root.squashfs

== Flashing Instructions for IPQ devices

*Generic Flashing Instructions*

* In U-Boot prompt, Download the Firmware Image which needs to be flashed into the Target

[source,bash]
----
tftpb <file_name>
----

* Once the Image is downloaded, Flash the image into the respective partition

[source,bash]
----
flash <partition_name>
----

*Flashing in eMMC boards*

* Execute the below set of commands to flash kernel and rootfs image into `IPQ emmc flash variant boards`

[source,bash]
----
tftpb <Kernel_Image> && flash 0:HLOS

tftpb <Rootfs_Image> && flash rootfs
----

*Flashing in NAND Boards*

* Execute the below set of commands to flash kernel and rootfs image into `IPQ nand flash variant boards`

[source,bash]
----
tftpb <Kernel_Image> && flash kernel

tftpb <Rootfs_Image> && flash ubi_rootfs
----

== Verification of the built Image

* In the generated OpenWRT Image, We could able to validate the below features
  1. OpenWrt version - 24.10.0
  2. GCC version     - GCC 13.3.0 r28427-6df0e3d02a
  3. Ethernet - WAN
  4. Ethernet - LAN
  5. WiFi Interface up and running
  6. WiFi Client connectivity - 2G
  7. WiFi Client connectivity - 5G
  8. Ping from AP to 2G client
  9. Ping from AP to 5G client
  10. Speed test in 2G client
  11. Speed test in 5G client

=== Ethernet

* IP Address is assigned to the WAN Interface of the Target device.
* And Target device could able to reach Internet through WAN Network.

== Key Takeaways

`feed-ipq` can be extended for building the mainline OpenWrt for IPQ based devices.
This feed can also be used in OpenWrt based router Operating System like prplOS,
IOWRT and openWiFi.
